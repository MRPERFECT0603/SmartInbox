## Architecture Overview

### Email Fetching

- **Cron Job**: A scheduled cron job fetches new emails from the user's Gmail account at regular intervals.
- **Kafka**: The fetched emails are sent to Kafka, ensuring reliable message queuing and delivery to the processing pipeline.

### Email Processing and Analysis

- **Node.js Service**: The Node.js service retrieves emails from Kafka and forwards them to the analyzer service.
- **Analyzer Service**: Utilizes Llama models to analyze the content of each email, categorizing it into predefined labels such as "Interested," "Not Interested," and "More Information."
- **RabbitMQ**: Manages task scheduling and queuing for both the processing and response phases, ensuring efficient and scalable operations.

### Automated Email Response

- Based on the analysis, the service generates contextually appropriate replies using AI and sends them to the original sender.
- **Gmail API**: The replies are sent using the Gmail API, and the corresponding labels are updated to reflect the categorization.
